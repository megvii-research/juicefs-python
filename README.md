## What is this ?


[JuiceFS](https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs) is a high-performance POSIX file system released under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.

`juicefs-python` is JuiceFS Python SDK, provides a majority of APIs in `os` module, complete APIs of `io.FileIO` and `io.open()`, based on JuiceFS APIs.

Currently `juicefs-python` only works on Linux, feel free to open an issue if you want to use it on other platforms.

## Installation

### PyPI

Use pip install JuiceFS Python SDK package:
```
pip install juicefs
```

### Build from Source

Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:megvii-research/juicefs-python.git
```

And then install requirements:

```
cd juicefs-python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you want to develop based on JuiceFS Python SDK package, you may want to `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`.

## Quick Start

Here're some code snippets help you hands on:

âš  Caution:"read-write" mode and "appending" mode are not supported by juicefs, so don't use them so as not to cause errors.

```python
from juicefs import JuiceFS

# all juicefs-python APIs need a JuiceFS object
# Param config tells how to start juicefs
jfs = JuiceFS(name="test", config=None)

for filename in jfs.listdir("/"):
    jfs.symlink(filename, "{}.link".format(filename))

filename = "/test.file"
if not jfs.path.exists(filename):
    jfs.create(filename, 0x777)

from juicefs import open as jfs_open
import os

with jfs_open(jfs, filename, 'wb') as f:
    f.write(b'hello world')
    f.seek(0, os.SEEK_SET)
    f.write(b'hey')

with jfs_open(jfs, filename, 'rb') as f:
    assert f.read(5) == b'heylo'
    f.seek(1, os.SEEK_CUR)
    assert f.read() == b'world'

```
